# Thinkpad-P51-Linux
Scripts that I made for getting some functions of the Thinkpad P51 working under Linux. I use Arch Linux btw, but the scripts should work on other distros as well.

## File Structure
I will upload the scripts according to the directories I have them installed in. I don't use relative file paths, but I will add a comment on the end of the lines that need to be changed for your file path.
